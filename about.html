<p>Hello! I am Irmak. I am a recent Msc Data Science graduate from University of Bath. I am highly interested in machine learning algirhtms 
  and data analysis. Throughout my education I was able to extend my knowledge in programming languages of Python, R and Java. Due to focusing more on Python
  during my MSc degree, I would say I am mostly proficient in this programming language and its libraries such as keras, tensorflow, pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
  In addition to these programming languages I also took certain database related courses both in my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees which made me hgihly capable in SQL. For more information
  about my education and work experience feel free to explore the links below.</p>
